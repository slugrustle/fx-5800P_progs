# fx-5800P\_progs

This repository contains Greatest Common Divisor (GCD),
Least Common Multiple (LCM), and Integer Factorization (FACTOR)
program listings for the Casio fx-5800P programmable calculator.

## Getting Started

Takumako's CcLinker and USB dongle provide the quickest way
to transfer programs to the fx-5800P. See
[https://cclinker.web.fc2.com/](https://cclinker.web.fc2.com/).
The .cce and .ccl files in this repository are for use with
CcEditor and CcLinker, respectively.

Otherwise, you will have to open the .pdf or .txt listing
for the program of interest and type the code into your
calculator.

## Contributing

I would love to receive bug reports and user
feedback. If you have improvements to the code,
please get in touch.
