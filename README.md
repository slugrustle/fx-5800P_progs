# fx-5800P\_progs

This repository contains Greatest Common Denominator (GCD) and
Least Common Multiple (LCM) program listings for the Casio 
fx-5800P programmable calculator. This lovely calculator ships
without these useful routines, but it can be programmed to 
remedy this deficit.

## Getting Started

Unfortunately, there is no computer interface for the Casio fx-5800P. 
You will have to open the .pdf or .txt listing for the program of 
interest and type the code into your calculator.

## Contributing

I would love to receive bug reports and user
feedback. If you have improvements to the code,
please get in touch.

[Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/index.html) was helpful for producing
the .pdf program listings that appear in this repository.

The [DejaVu Fonts](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/) have sufficient unicode coverage
to display the various special characters used by fx-5800P programs. These fonts
appear in the .pdf program listings.
